						So I've had a bit of a thing for using API's recently and just seeing what could be done. I wired up
						a jQuery function to ajax in json from a flickr search and thought 'This is pretty sweet!...how can
						I use it though!?'. I sat down and started designing this site (in the browser as you can probably
						tell), and thought, 'man, I really can't be arsed to open Photoshop and start manipulating imag...
						hang on!' - and thus the header was born.

					<h4>
						Performance

					<p>
						<strong class="invalid">Yes.</strong> the header does make 4 AJAX requests to retrieve all of the images shown.
						<strong class="invalid">Yes.</strong> this is 4 whole separate requests to be made straight away on page load.
						<strong class="invalid">Yes.</strong> this will never be cached as the images are loaded externally each time.
						<strong class="invalid">Yes.</strong> if you have a shitty connection, chances are you're not going to like it.
					</p>
					<h4>
						My reasoning
					</h4>
					<p>
						<strong class="valid">But.</strong> this is taking design in a browser to the next level, I didn't have to open
						Photoshop once to achieve a fully designed header.
						<strong class="valid">And.</strong> this is an incredibly easy way to show everything that's relevant to me, and
						to who Iam as a person in one area.
						<strong class="valid">And.</strong> everytime someone uploads a new photo to flickr with one of these keywords,
						hey guess what? My header changes. In theory, this thing could completely change every 5 seconds,
						no randomize functions, no database full of items to pull out, no massive overhead from the code
						that I've had to write.
						<strong class="valid">And.</strong> if you're a normal person and an avid web user, chances are you have a 
						decent connection and this thing is going to take you a couple of seconds to download.
						<strong class="valid">And.</strong> from a webdev point of view, how frickin' cool is that thing!?
					</p>
					<p>
						Every now and again we have to step out of that extremely compact and strict professional network
						that we're used to to try something new, and learn something new. Personal sites and blogs are the 
						perfect place to do this, hey, I'm not saying start ajaxing half of the internet into your website
						because you can't be arsed to write your own content or make your own design, but is this really
						that bad every now and again? Personally I think it's pretty damn awesome.

				Hi. I'm Jamie Lawrence, or J. I'm a web developer and designer, passionate music lover, gamer and 
				general dude from High Wycombe, UK. My skillset includes ASP.NET(C#), HTML(4/5), CSS(2/3), Javascript,
				 jQuery, Ruby on Rails and extended knowledge of client and server side applications. My career has
				passed my by pretty quick so far, I currently work as a Team Leader in a Web Development department
				for one of the UK's largest e-commerce platform providers. On this site you'll find anything me, the
				main focus will most probably be code related, but hey I'm only human, so if you're a fellow developer
				you might have to shift through some music and general rant related posts to get to other tastier
				stuff.
